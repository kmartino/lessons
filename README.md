## What is this?<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

This is a small collection of aphorisms, quotes, poems, clippings and
thoughts that to me, are worth remembering, keeping close, and passing
on. Sprinkled througout are a few of my own thoughts, influenced in no
small part by the people cited here, and by my own experience. I'll be
adding plenty of hyperlinks throughout, I'm slightly embarrassed there
are not enough of them yet.

I'm still adding and correcting attributions. If you notice anything
missing, make sure to tell me at kmartino at pobox dot com and I'll
correct it.

Even better, do a pull request!

## Personal Mission Statement<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a>

The following is a personal mission statement I wrote shortly after
reading "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People", by Stephen
Covey. I try and keep this central to my life, in order to be the best
person I can be, by exercising my core beliefs. I wrote this after
getting inspired from a post by Dave Rogers on his old blog "Time's
Shadow".

*** To live my life as an expression of the principals I believe in: ***

People shine when given the chance to create, express and grow. **Empower**.

People feel the need to be understood, just as, or even more strongly then the need to be loved. **Listen**.

People don’t need more opinions, we already drown in data. People need clarity. **Drill down**.

People learn from example, not only from words. **Exemplify**.

People are attracted to honesty and have bullshit detectors. **Be true**.

People need new experiences to expand their knowledge of reality. **Adventure**.

People can learn from their mistakes. Recognize, **Don’t fear failure**.

People search for simple solutions to problems when they are rarely simple. **Dig**.

People shine when they believe they can make a lasting impact, this may be the core of everything we do. **Inspire**.

People and companies are driven by visions, not ideologies. **Lead**.

Ignorance is fear of the truth. Truth is more important than pride. **Learn**.

A life without passion is a life not lived. **Live**.

Faith is the cure to doubt. **Have Faith**.

When you forgive, you are forgiven. **Forgive**.

Love is stronger than death. **Love**.


## Principles from Programming<a id="sec-3" name="sec-3"></a>

Software Engineering provides a means of problem solving that uniquely
reflects human nature. It traverses both arts and sciences. Because of
this, it provides lessons that can be used in life in general.

-   Complex problems are just a series of simpler problems smushed
    together.
-   Pay attention to ***where*** systems, layers, resources and people communicate.
-   Solve problems, don't just point them out.
-   Steal ideas liberally from everyone else. Originality is not a
    virtue. Learn from the past.
-   Put trust in people, not in things.
-   Don't build solutions that try to do everything.
-   Create solutions that play nicely with others, do only
    a few things, and do them well.
-   Perfectionism can be taken too far. It's best to get a solution that
    does most of what you want to do then none at all.
-   Projects must have solid deliverables. Only when goals are can be
    stated in clear cut terms can they be achieved.
-   Sometimes you need to do the things that failures do not like to do.
-   Every project begins with that first step. And sometimes it is the
    hardest.
-   Schedule your priorities, not the other way around.
-   A shared success is one that will last and grow.
-   Projects that aren't solutions to diagnosed needs are wasteful
    projects. They are doomed to failure. Especially true in technology.
    While technology may expose new capabilities - it is more typically
    true that it is business need that should be satisfied by
    technology - not the other way around.
-   Continuously improve skills and knowledge by seeing what others are
    doing in the world.

## Beliefs<a id="sec-4" name="sec-4"></a>

-   I believe life is like a card game. We have no control over the
    cards we are dealt. We have **do** control over how
    we play them.
    -   This means that who we are is determined by the decisions we've
        made, the decisions we are making, the gifts we've been given, and
        the context we are living in.
    -   Good cards are dealt to bad people. And bad cards are dealt to
        good people. The trick is not to get caught up in why, but to
        focus on the cards themselves, and to try your best.
    -   If you are worried about the hands you may be dealt in the future,
        you won't be able to play the hand you have.
    -   If you are too concerned with bad hands you've been dealt in the
        past, you won't be able to play the hand you have.
    -   I believe that education, experience, information, rationality,
        love and faith can help us decide how to play the cards we are
        dealt, and a belief that we have CHOICE needs to proceed them.
-   I believe the root of human nature is good and derived from rules
    written by God on our hearts.
-   I believe in that a rising tide lifts all boats. The success of
    those around me helps elevate me with them. That means it is an
    investment in myself to help someone else be a success.
-   I believe that technology does not change human nature. It changes
    **how** we do things, not why.
-   John Adams in 1787 defined the ideal government as "a government, in
    which all men, rich and poor, magistrates and subjects, officers and
    people, masters and servants, the first citizen and the last, are
    ***equally*** subject to the laws."
-   The purpose of government is to address problems collectively that
    we can't solve individually, this includes common defense
    and the general welfare of its citizens.
-   Laws should be subject to to continuous reform to support current
    and future circumstances. Law and regulation are the software of
    government.
-   Informed general participation in government, by all, is a goal worth
    fighting for.
-   I believe when we see no one on high brought to answer to Rule of
    Law, and only those who are poor or weak brought before it, trust in
    shared government erodes.
-   Literacy and education are requirements for healthy citizenry and it
    is self-destructive for a society not support them.
-   Some services have no profit motive and thus, are better served by
    civil servants rather than private corporations.
-   Affordable access to quality healthcare is a fundamental right.
-   I believe all human beings have a right to live with dignity and
    respect.
-   Marketing has a side effect of dividing people into smaller and
    smaller groups. If one group is denouncing another group, and you
    buy into it, you are being devided just for someone to sell
    something.
-   Technology and media enable ever faster feedback pipelines. This
    enables ever quicker decisions to be made. This does not equate to
    better decision making.

## On Human Nature, Technology, Music and Art<a id="sec-5" name="sec-5"></a>


> Technology enables people to shrink time and effort between a desire
> and a result. When making something that isn't for the purpose of
> expression, ask whose life you are making easier and why.

&mdash; <cite>Karl Martino</cite>


> Human Nature is unchanging. Technology does not change what human
> beings do, but how. People are no more selfish or generous today then
> they were a hundred generations ago. What's changed is the context
> within which we live.

&mdash; <cite>Karl Martino (inspired by Dave Rogers)</cite>


> Saying that Human Nature is unchanging is not the same as saying **we**
> can't change, or the systems and context within which we live can't
> change. Far from it. We live in a world that would be thought
> impossible just two generations ago. And people who have bad habits
> can change them, by changing the context within which they live.

&mdash; <cite>Karl Martino</cite>


> Small minds try to form religions, the great ones just want better routes up the mountain.

&mdash; <cite>Alan C. Kay, "The Early History of Smalltalk"</cite>


> A man is what he thinks about all day long.

&mdash; *Emerson*

> Learn the idea, and you don't need to memorize the details. The idea
> stays the same; the details change.

&mdash; *Shai Simonson, Rediscovering Mathematics*

> Empathy takes time, and efficiency is for things, not people.

&mdash; *Stephen Covey*

> Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce
> designs whose structure are copies of the communication structures of
> these organizations.

&mdash; *Melvin Conway*

> Two people can see the same thing, disagree, and yet both be right.
> It's not logical; it's psychological.

&mdash; *Stephen Covey*

> It is one thing to make a mistake, and quite another thing not to
> admit it. People will forgive mistakes, because mistakes are usually
> of the mind, mistakes of judgment. But people will not easily forgive
> the mistakes of the heart, the ill intention, the bad motives, the
> prideful justifying cover-up of the first mistake.

&mdash; *Stephen Covey*

> "Three chords and the form of the blues is a Western wisdom if you'd
> be quiet/ but therefore I have to sing blind as if I were in the midst
> of a holy night/ It was better to interpret the occasion as angelic
> rather than as demonic otherwise we'd all be benighted/ It is best to
> pray from the heart when the angry voice or the fearful voice arise/
> I'll end my song and finish with blues and say goodnight unto your
> eyes/ O Gregory, now the term is over for you and me, the night is
> finished for the poetry/ We'll start again May 7th, if you will be at
> the New School then you and I will have a bout/ but we need not, at
> this or that time, scream and shout/ So therefore I will say in
> silence ending all my song, goodnight"

&mdash; *Allen Ginsberg*

> It is not a science. It is maybe engineering, it is maybe art. It has a lot
> to do with magic. It is not about Computers in the same sense that
> Geometry is not about using surveying instruments. It is easy to
> confuse the essence of what you are doing with the tools that you
> use. In the future people will look back and think about and
> mention those primitives in the 20th century fiddling around with
> those gadgets called computers but really what they were doing was
> starting to learn how to formalize intuitions about process, about
> how to do things. Starting to develop a way to talk precisely about
> 'how to' knowlege. As opposed to Geometry which talks about 'what
> is true'.

&mdash; *[Lecture 1A | MIT 6.001 Structure and Interpretation, 1986](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Op3QLzMgSY)*

> The ability to specifiy a behavioral contract between specification
> and implementaton, along with the fact that method implementations can
> invoke arbitrary code, allows applications to outlive data.

&mdash; *Erik Meijer, ACM Magazine September 2012*

> ...as the abstraction ladder has shown, all we know are
> abstractions. What you know about the chair you are sitting in is an
> abstraction from the totality of the chair. When you eat white bread
> you cannot tell by the taste whether it has been "enriched by vitamin
> B" as it says on the wrapper; you simply have to trust that the
> process (from which the words "vitamin B" are abstracted) was
> performed. What you know about your spouse - even a spouse of thirty
> years - is again an abstraction. Distrusting all abstractions simply
> does not make sense.
>
> The test of abstractions then is not whether they are "high-level" or
> "low-level" abstractions, but *whether they are referable to lower
> levels*. If one makes a statement about "culinary arts in
> America", one should be able to refer the statements down the
> abstraction ladder to particulars of American restraunts, American
> domestic science, American techniques of food preservation, down to
> Mrs. Levin in her kitchen. If one makes a statement about "civil
> rights in Wisconsin," one should know something about national, state
> and local statutes; one should also know something about the behavior
> of police officers, magistrates, judges, academic authorities, hotel
> managers, and the general public in Wisconson, all of which acts and
> whose decisions affect that minimum of decent treatment in the courts,
> in politics, and in society that we call "civil rights." A preacher, a
> professor, a journalist, or a politician whose high-level abstractions
> can systematically and surely be referred to lower-level abstractions
> is not only talking but saying something.

&mdash; *S.I. Hayakawa, Language in Thought and Action*

## On Fate, Self Determination, and Free Will<a id="sec-6" name="sec-6"></a>

> Life is a card game. You have no control over the cards dealt. But
> you do have control over how you play your hand.

&mdash; *Karl Martino (and a few million other people)*

> Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will
> not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius
> will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education alone will
> not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and
> determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan Press On, has solved
> and will always solve the problems of the human race.

&mdash; *Calvin Coolidge*

> There are two mindsets people have: Either believing that we are
> 'fixed' - what we are is what we are - or that we can change and
> grow if the right conditions are met. The second mindset is
> supported by science.

&mdash; *Karl Martino (reflecting on Carol Dweck's "Mindset")*

> It is not the strongest that survives, nor the most intelligent that
> survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.

&mdash; *Charles Darwin*

> Don't compare yourself with others. Just try and be the best person
> you can be. Compete with yourself.

&mdash; *Mindset, by Carol Dweck*


> If you can keep your head when all about you
> Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;
> If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
> But make allowance for their doubting too:
> If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
> Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,
> Or being hated don't give way to hating,
> And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;
>
> If you can dream&#x2014;and not make dreams your master;
> If you can think&#x2014;and not make thoughts your aim,
> If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
> And treat those two impostors just the same:.
> If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
> Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
> Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
> And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools;
>
> If you can make one heap of all your winnings
> And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
> And lose, and start again at your beginnings,
> And never breathe a word about your loss:
> If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
> To serve your turn long after they are gone,
> And so hold on when there is nothing in you
> Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"
>
> If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
> Or walk with Kings&#x2014;nor lose the common touch,
> If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
> If all men count with you, but none too much:
> If you can fill the unforgiving minute
> With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
> Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
> And&#x2014;which is more&#x2014;you'll be a Man, my son!

&mdash; *If, Rudyard Kipling*

> I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift,
> nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet
> riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but
> time and chance happeneth to them all.

&mdash; Ecclesiastes 9:11-12

> "Learning how to think" really means learning how to exercise some
>  control over how and what you think.
>
> It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay
> attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience.
>
> Because if you cannot or will not exercise this kind of choice in
> adult life, you will be totally hosed.

&mdash; *This is Water, David Foster Wallace*

> Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a
> habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny.

&mdash; *Stephen Covey*

> Live out of your imagination, not your history.

&mdash; *Stephen Covey*

> There is no such thing as a 'self-made' man. We are made up of
> thousands of others. Everyone who has ever done a kind deed for us, or
> spoken one word of encouragement to us, has entered into the makeup of
> our character and of our thoughts, as well as our success.

&mdash; *George Burton Adams*

> Ever since the Industrial Revolution, Western society has benefited
> from science, logic, and reductionism over intuition and holism.
> Psychologically and politically we would much rather assume that the
> cause of a problem is "out there," rather than "in here." It's almost
> irresistible to blame something or someone else, to shift
> responsibility away from ourselves, and to look for the control knob,
> the product, the pill, the technical fix that will make a problem go
> away.
>
> Serious problems have been solved by focusing on external
> agents - preventing smallpox, increasing food production, moving large
> weights and many people rapidly over long distances. Because they are
> embedded in larger systems, however, some of our "solutions" have
> created further problems. And some problems, those most rooted in the
> internal structure of complex systems, the real messes, have refused
> to go away.
>
> Hunger, poverty, environmental degradation, economic instability,
> unemployment, chronic disease, drug addiction, and war, for example,
> persist in spite of the analytical ability and technical brilliance
> that have been directed toward eradicating them. No one deliberately
> creates those problems, no one wants them to persist, but they persist
> nonetheless. That is because they are intrinsically systems problems -
> undesirable behaviors characteristic of the system structures that
> produce them. They will yield only as we reclaim our intuition, stop
> casting blame, see the system as the source of its own problems, and
> find the courage and wisdom to restructure it.
>
> Obvious. Yet subversive. An old way of seeing. Yet somehow new.

&mdash; *Thinking in Systems, A Primer, Donella Meadows*

> If one purges the Judaism of the Prophets and Chrristianity as Jesus

&mdash; *Albert Einstein*

## On Starting and Finishing<a id="sec-7" name="sec-7"></a>

> I'm scared.
>
> I'm scared that my abilities are gone

> I'm scared that I'm going to fuck this up

## On living honestly, and not selling out<a id="sec-8" name="sec-8"></a>

> Creating a life that reflects your values and satisfies your soul is
> a rare achievement. In a culture that relentlessly promotes avarice
> and excess as the good life, a person happy doing his own work is
> usually considered an eccentric, if not a subversive. Ambition is
> only understood if it's to rise to the top of some imaginary ladder
> of success. Someone who takes an undemanding job because it affords
> him the time to pursue other interests and activities is considered
> a flake. A person who abandons a career in order to stay home and

>
> You'll be told in a hundred ways, some subtle and some not, to keep

>
> To invent your own life's meaning is not easy, but it's still
> allowed, and I think you'll be happier for the trouble.
>
> Reading those turgid philosophers here in these remote stone

> to ask yourself questions about what makes life truthful,
> purposeful, meaningful, and redeeming, you have the Swiss Army Knife

&mdash; *Kenyon College Commencement, Bill Watterson*

## On Depression and Anxiety<a id="sec-9" name="sec-9"></a>

> Whenever a person is faced in life with a choice, his whole being
> trembles with the dilemma of what to do. It trembles because, being
> human, he wants both things but can’t have both; because deciding
> always means being altered; and because alteration, however desirable,
> is always violent. Anxiety is the stage a person has to pass through
> on his way to creating himself.
>
> &#x2026;Everyone, in Kierkegaard’s estimation, feels anxiety; it’s part of the
> human condition. What separates the men from the boys is how you
> respond. Boys shut their eyes— they refuse to look into the abyss. The
> men look. They own up to ambiguity and conflict. They own up to
> reality. They are more tuned in to life as it actually is. A friend of
> mine who read a lot of Sartre used to say, “We all make decisions.
> Some of us more than others.” Kierkegaard said, “The greater the
> anxiety the greater the man.”

&mdash; *Monkey Mind, Daniel Smith*

> The key point is that anxiety is not a feeling, but something we do to
> ward off feelings. Anxiety is a strategy we use to avoid
> feeling things.

&mdash; *Cary Tennis*

> Deep within every human being there still lives the anxiety over the
> possibility of being alone in the world, forgotten by God, overlooked
> among the millions and millions in this enormous household. A person
> keeps this anxiety at a distance by looking at the many round about
> who are related to him as kin and friends, but the anxiety is still
> there.

&mdash; *Kierkegaard*

> How to face the facts, quit worrying, and do something about it:
>
> Rule one:
>
> To avoid worry - live in day-type compartments.
>
> Rule two:
>
> Next time Trouble backs you up:
> a. Ask youself what's the worst that can happen
> b. Prepare yourself to accept the worst
> c. Calmly try and improve the worst
>
> Rule three:
>
> Remind yourself the price you can pay in your health for worry.
> Those who do not know how to fight worry die young.

&mdash; *Dale Carnegie*

## The future, the past, and now: on anxiety, depression, and tao<a id="sec-10" name="sec-10"></a>

> There are three ways of looking at life: looking at the past, being in
> the present, and looking to the future. Some people spend too much
> time doing the first or last, and not enough time in the here and now.

&mdash; *Karl Martino*

> Whatever you are doing - right now - you are practicing. What you are
> practicing, you are growing. What do you want to see grow?

&mdash; *Karl Martino*

> Answering the 'what do I want to see grow' question impacts all
> decisions, from what to do on a Saturday afternoon, to whether you
> should move to a different city for your work. It makes near term
> and long term destinations clear, and then all that is left is to
> play the game, or maximize your potential, to enjoy the journey of
> getting there. It also explains why the Gordon Gekkos and Julius
> Caesars of the world, who play the game just for its own sake, are
> generally unhappy and unsuccessful in their own eyes, even though
> they appear to be doing everything right.

&mdash; *You Are Not Running Out Of Time, Rahul Bijlani*

> Shutting off the thought process is not rejuvenating; the mind is like

### Whenever you feel anxiety or are depressed about something, consider the ABCs:<a id="sec-10-1" name="sec-10-1"></a>

We can't change the Adversities we face. But we can change our Beliefs
about them, which will lead to new Consequences. It's not Adversity
that creates our reactions, but our beliefs about the adversity. When
you Dispute, Dispel or Distract them, you are left with new Effects.

1.  Adversity: What is the setback or challenge you just faced?
2.  Belief: What is your Belief about the Adversity?
3.  Consequence: What is the Consequence of your Belief?
4.  Dispute, Dispel, Distract, Distance: Recognize the Belief is a cognitive distortion.
5.  Effect: After Disputing the Belief, how you feel will be changed.

### Advice for myself, and for other parents<a id="sec-10-3" name="sec-10-3"></a>

- Criticize behavior, not character.
- Teach children their ABCs: A is for adversity, B is for beliefs, and
  C is for consequences.
- Teach children how to dispute their negative thoughts.
- Children need to try things on their own, fail at them, and
  experience negative emotions like sadness and frustration.
- They need to learn to persist in the face of failure. Without
  failure and persistence, there's no mastery (the feeling of being in
  control and knowing that taking certain actions get specific
  results).
- Encourage Exploration and Curiosity: Curious people are open-minded,
  they want to know more about the world and about other people.
- Give Conditional Praise.
- Give Unconditional Love.
